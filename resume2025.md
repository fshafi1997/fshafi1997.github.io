## ?? About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer and consultant with a strong track record of building scalable systems and delivering high-impact modernization projects powered by AI. I’ve worked across high-growth environments like **MongoDB**, **Amazon**, and **Juniper Networks**, bringing legacy systems into the future through intelligent tooling and LLM integration.

Whether it's guiding enterprise clients through cloud-native transformation, optimizing big data pipelines, or building production-ready LLM features at Amazon scale — I love solving hard problems and driving innovation.
